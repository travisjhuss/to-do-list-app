## Description

This is a straight forward to-do list app with a few basic features. 

I started by making a very thorough to-do list for my to-do list app. It was very meta. Once I got basic set-up stuff done like setting up files and connecting them, I started setting up my html. I decided that I was gonna use div's to append my tasks to the DOM and set up each div as a grid container. I put some dummy tasks on there so I could do some simple styling on the grid. 

Once I had a decent skeleton I got to work on all the routes and logic for PG. Once I had my GET, POST, and DELETE set up I got to work on more styling. I was recently introduced to Material Icons and wanted to make my delete and edit buttons more interesting. I also wanted to do something different with the check done feature and used a toggle switch. I found a great resource on w3schools to help with that. Once I had that set up, I did a PUT for checking the task as done. That task then becomes less opaque to mark it done. I spent way too much time on this switch but learned a lot. 

I wanted a clipboard icon in my header and found a free one online. I gave credit to where I got it in my footer. Once I found an image I liked I based my color palette around it. I really enjoy styling and had fun working on this. 

Once I had something I liked with all the required functionality I started on some features/stretch goals. I wanted the ability to order the list by a few of the different DB columns. This was also fun to work on as it required a lot of thinking of when and where the logic should occur. I think theres room to expand it more but happy with how it came out. 

Unfortunately I maxed myself out working on this on Saturday. I try to have just about everything done by the end of Saturday so that I can write the README and do some basic editing on Sunday morning giving myself a reset day. If I had more time, and I may pursue this later, I included an edit button but didn't get to add the full function. I was hoping to set it up so that the user can edit in the grid container of that task. I knew this would be an undertaking so left it alone, for now. I also didn't get to styling the inputs a little more. Finally, I completely forgot to work on branching here. I had wanted to do that with each new feature along the way but spaced on it.

All in all, as someone who makes to-do lists often, this was a great assignment.
