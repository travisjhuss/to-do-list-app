# What To Do's

## Description

This is a straight forward to-do list app with a few basic features. It was a weekend assignment from Prime Digital Academy that was our introduction to working with databases and SQL. 

The app has the ability to add tasks under a few different categories where you can set a priority level to it as well. Tasks can be deleted and sorted by the various attributes assigned to that task. 

What To Do's was built mainly with jQuery and Bootstrap for styling. 

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` to start server

## Built With

- jQuery
- Node
- Express
- PostgreSQL
